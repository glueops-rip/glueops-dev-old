# Setting Up Your Repository

In the [deployment-configurations](https://github.com/GlueOps/deployment-configurations) repository you can centrally manage configurations for deployments on the GlueOps Platform. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your repository, providing a detailed explanation of its structure and how to customize it to suit your organization's needs. 

:::info
 Here is the [deployment-configurations](https://github.com/GlueOps/deployment-configurations) template you use to ease setup overhead.
:::

## Directory Structure

The [deployment-configurations](https://github.com/GlueOps/deployment-configurations)repository is organized into three core directories:

```sh
deployment-configurations
├── apps
├── common
├── env-overlays
```

- **apps**: Contains configurations for each application deployed on the GlueOps Platform.
- **common**: Holds configurations shared across all deployments on the platform. It allows you to avoid repetition of configuration files for more efficient setups.
- **env-overlays**: Contains configurations applied to groups of environments, like "prod" and "nonprod."


## `apps` Directory

The `apps` directory is where you define the applications deployed on the GlueOps Platform and the environments for each application.  Here's is how it's structured:

```sh
apps
├── front-end-antonios-tacos
│   ├── base
│   │   └── base-values.yaml
│   └── envs
│       ├── previews
│       ├── prod
│       ├── stage
│       └── uat
└── back-end-antonios-tacos
    ├── base
    │   └── base-values.yaml
    └── envs
        ├── previews
        ├── prod
        ├── stage
        └── uat
```


In the directory, we have two applications deployed on the platform: `front-end-antonios-tacos` and `back-end-antonios-tacos`.

- The `base-values.yaml` file in the `base` directory contains configurations shared among all environments, such as the image repository and image pull policy.
- The `values.yaml` file is placed under each specific environment directory (`prod`, `uat`, `stage`) within the `envs` directory this contains environment-specific configurations like image tags, secrets, and ports.
- The `previews` file within the `envs` directory allows you to configure ephemeral deployments based on open pull requests.

```sh
apps
├── front-end-antonios-tacos
│   ├── base
│   │   └── base-values.yaml
│   └── envs
│       ├── previews
│       ├── prod
│       ├── stage
│       └── uat
└── back-end-antonios-tacos
    ├── base
    │   └── base-values.yaml
    └── envs
        ├── previews
        ├── prod
        ├── stage
        └── uat
```

## `env-overlays` Directory

The `env-overlays` directory contains directories representing groups of environments. Here, you can configure settings common to specific environments. Here's the structure:

```sh
env-overlays
├── nonprod
│   └── env-values.yaml
└── prod
    └── env-values.yaml
```

Each directory contains an `env-values.yaml` file with these configurations.

- The `nonprod` directory contains configurations applied to all non-production environments, like `stage` and `uat`.
- The `prod` directory contains configurations that apply to the production environment.

## Creating Your `deployment-configurations` Repository

To set up your `deployment-configurations` repository:

1. Create a new repository using the provided [template](https://github.com/new?template_name=deployment-configurations&template_owner=GlueOps) in your GitHub organization.

2. Replace the sample application names (`front-end-antonios-tacos` and `back-end-antonios-tacos`) with the names of your applications that you want to deploy.

:::info
The names of each directory _must_ match the names of the associated application repositories containing the application code.
:::

3. Under the `apps` directory, add new directories for each additional application you want to deploy.

4. Within each application directory, create subdirectories to match the environments you want to deploy to (e.g., `stage`, `prod`, `uat`).

:::info
There is no maximum number of directories per environment. You can choose to have environments like stage, prod, and uat, or just stage and prod based on your needs.
:::

5. Customize each environment's `values.yaml` file within the respective environment directories with environment-specific configurations.

6. Repeat the above steps for each application and environment you want to manage in your repository.

For example, if you want to deploy the applications `data-api` in `stage` and `prod` environments and `commerce-front-end` in `uat` and `prod` environments, the resulting directory structure would look like this:

```sh
deployment-configurations
├── apps
│   ├── back-end-antonios-tacos
│   │   ├── base
│   │   │   └── base-values.yaml
│   │   └── envs
│   │       ├── previews
│   │       │   ├── common
│   │       │   │   └── values.yaml
│   │       │   └── pull-request-number
│   │       │       └── 1
│   │       │           └── values.yaml
│   │       ├── prod
│   │       │   └── values.yaml
│   │       ├── stage
│   │       │   └── values.yaml
│   │       └── uat
│   │           └── values.yaml
│   └── front-end-antonios-tacos
│       ├── base
│       │   └── base-values.yaml
│       └── envs
│           ├── previews
│           │   ├── common
│           │   │   └── values.yaml
│           │   └── pull-request-number
│           │       └── 1
│           │           └── values.yaml
│           ├── prod
│           │   └── values.yaml
│           ├── stage
│           │   └── values.yaml
│           └── uat
│               └── values.yaml
├── common
│   └── common-values.yaml
├── env-overlays
│   ├── nonprod
│   │   └── env-values.yaml
│   └── prod
│       └── env-values.yaml
```

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and organize your deployment configurations on the GlueOps Platform, providing better control and consistency across your applications and environments.
