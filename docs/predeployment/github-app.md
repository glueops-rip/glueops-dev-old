# Creating your GitHub App

The GlueOps Platform utilizes a GitHub App to access your GitHub Organizations to provide the following services:

* Deployment of Tenant Applications via a [deployment-configurations](https://github.com/GlueOps/deployment-configurations) repository
* Pull Request comments, generated by the [pull-request-bot](https://github.com/GlueOps/pull-request-bot), to display helpful links associated with preview environments.

To enable GlueOps access to your GitHub organization, you will need to provide the following values:

- [github_tenant_app_id](#create-the-github-app-id)
- [github_tenant_app_b64enc_private_key](#generate-the-private-key)
- [github_tenant_app_installation_id](#get-installation-id)

:::info
For each cluster you deploy with the GlueOps platform, create a separate GitHub app and name it accordingly.

Follow the step-by-step guide below to obtain these values:

- Open the downloaded key file and generate a Base64-encoded version using the following command:

```
cat <downloaded-keyfile>.pem | base64 -w 0
```
Replace `<downloaded-keyfile>` with the actual name of the downloaded key file.
